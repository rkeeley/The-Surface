# The Surface

Things to do:
    - documentation
    - logging
    - toggles for removing tracks from the maintained playlist, etc.
    - local files/tracks all over the script
        - currently they aren't added to the playlist
    - any more parameterization?
    - figure out how limits work across the API
    - sort the songs in the playlist by artist name
        - right now they're sorted by first-saved because of how the code works
