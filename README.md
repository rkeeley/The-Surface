# The Surface

Things to do:
    - documentation
    - toggles for removing tracks from the maintained playlist, etc.
    - local files/tracks all over the script
        - currently they aren't added to the playlist
    - parameterization, .env file support, etc. to handle things like managed playlist name
    - figure out how limits work across the API
    - sort the songs in the playlist by artist name
        - right now they're sorted by first-saved because of how the code works
    - create the playlist if it doesn't exist already
