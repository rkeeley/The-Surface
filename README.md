# The Surface

Create and manage Spotify playlists with one song per artist in your library.

### TODO

- I should host this somewhere
- change the code to use user logins instead of requiring so many tokens/keys
- make public on github when enough of this stuff is done
- documentation
- logging
    - Don't know if it would be worth logging all the changes made since it would slow down the script
    - but also it's python, so who maybe who cares
- parameterization
    - toggles for removing tracks from the maintained playlist, adding new ones, etc.
    - sorting order?
    - more?
- local files/tracks all over the script
    - currently they aren't added to the playlist

- sort the songs in the playlist by artist name
    - right now they're sorted by first-saved because of how the code works
